/**
 * Generates PDF-mockup-style queue numbers like "R0003", "M0001" — a
 * single letter prefix by service type, plus a 4-digit sequence that
 * resets daily.
 *
 * ASSUMPTION (flag for review against the actual mockup): the PDF only
 * showed two example numbers ("R0003", "M0001"), so only two of the six
 * QueueEntry.serviceType values have a confirmed prefix. The rest below
 * are reasonable guesses — check these against the real mockup and adjust
 * SERVICE_PREFIXES if they're wrong; nothing else needs to change to fix it.
 *
 *   "Medical Consultation"   -> "M"  (confirmed by mockup example M0001)
 *   "Quick Health Screening" -> "R"  (guessed: "Referral" — this prefix is
 *                                     only ever used when the fever-override
 *                                     rule escalates a self-service screening
 *                                     into the queue, which reads like a
 *                                     referral into the clinic rather than
 *                                     a scheduled service — fits R0003)
 *   "Dental Consultation"    -> "D"  (guessed)
 *   "Medical Clearance"      -> "C"  (guessed)
 *   "Prescription/OTC Pickup"-> "P"  (guessed)
 *   "General Inquiry"        -> "G"  (guessed)
